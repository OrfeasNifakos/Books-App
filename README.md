# Book App

This application is a simple yet intuitive platform for book enthusiasts. It was created using the popular `create-react-app` scaffold which provides a robust starting point for React applications.

## Project Overview

Book Explorer allows users to search, view, and manage a list of books fetched from a public API. The main features include:
- **Book Browsing**: Users can browse a list of books provided by the [Gutendex API](https://gutendex.com/).
- **Book Details**: Clicking on a book card navigates to a detailed view where users can learn more about the book.
- **Favorites Management**: Users can add/delete books to their favorites, and manage this list within their browser's local storage.
